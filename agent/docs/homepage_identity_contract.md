# Homepage Research Identity Contract (v0)

This document defines the non-negotiable identity constraints for the public homepage.
It precedes all audits, copy edits, UX changes, and implementations.
Any proposed change must be evaluated against this contract.

---

## A. Identity Claims (Hard Assertions)

1. I am a PhD researcher in theoretical physics at the Weizmann Institute of Science. From particle and field-theoretic models to quantitative, time-dependent processes, my work has consistently focused on systems where structure, time, and dynamics matter. 

2. My work leads me to treat time semantics, execution constraints, and reproducibility as first-class objects when designing research systems.

3. This site documents a personal research lab and research engine built around that principle, and serves as a space for technical, research-level exploration and collaboration, with links to related research and selected projects provided for context.

## B. Negative Identity Space (Forbidden Inferences)

The homepage must not reasonably lead a reader to conclude that:

1. This site is a trading performance showcase or a display of returns, PnL, or alpha.
2. This site is a commercial product, startup landing page, or fundraising pitch.
3. This site is a portfolio marketing a “full-stack engineer” or general software developer profile.
4. This site is an AI agent demo, automation showcase, or prompt-engineering playground.
5. This site claims market profitability, production deployment, or operational trading scale.
6. This site positions its author as a financial advisor, trader-for-hire, or investment service provider.
7. This site overstates maturity, impact, or external adoption beyond what is directly verifiable.

Any element that plausibly encourages these interpretations is considered a violation.

## C. 15-Second Skim Contract

After 15 seconds on the homepage, a technically literate researcher should conclude that this is the personal research homepage of a theoretical physics PhD building rigorous, execution-aware quantitative research systems, and should not conclude that this is a trading pitch, product site, or performance-driven portfolio.

## D. Scope and Enforcement

- This contract governs homepage copy, layout emphasis, navigation labels, and visual hierarchy.
- All audits (Copywriter, Red Team, Designer) operate strictly within this contract.
- Decisions are resolved exclusively via `decision_matrix.md` using KEEP / TUNE / CUT.
- Only micro-level changes are permitted unless this contract is explicitly revised.
