# SoionLab Documentation Contract (v0)

This document defines the scope, intent, and non‑negotiable constraints of the SoionLab documentation area.
SoionLab is a **research engine and documentation space**, not a product, not a tutorial site, and not a performance showcase.

This contract governs content, layout emphasis, interaction patterns, and narrative framing inside the SoionLab section.

---

## A. Purpose (What SoionLab Is)

SoionLab exists to:

1. Document research systems, abstractions, and design decisions used in quantitative and theoretical work.
2. Make execution semantics, time ownership, and structural constraints explicit and inspectable.
3. Serve as a technical reference and discussion surface for research‑level collaborators.

SoionLab is **about how research systems are constructed and reasoned about**, not about outcomes or results.

---

## B. Non‑Goals (What SoionLab Is Not)

SoionLab must not be interpreted as:

1. A commercial product, SaaS platform, or startup documentation.
2. A trading system, signal service, or performance‑oriented framework.
3. A beginner tutorial, course, or step‑by‑step learning resource.
4. A general software engineering portfolio or “full‑stack” showcase.
5. A benchmark, leaderboard, or comparison against other tools.
6. A claim of production readiness, scale, or market deployment.

Any content that plausibly encourages these interpretations is considered a violation.

---

## C. Audience Assumptions

The intended reader is assumed to be:

- Technically literate (researcher / PhD / industry researcher / advanced practitioner)
- Comfortable with abstraction, formal reasoning, and system‑level thinking
- Interested in *why* systems are designed a certain way, not just *how* to use them

The documentation should not optimize for first‑time learners or casual readers.

---

## D. Content Scope and Structure

Allowed content types:

- Architectural overviews and layer diagrams
- Design principles and invariants (e.g. time ownership, execution validity)
- Contracts, interfaces, and semantics
- Failure modes, trade‑offs, and rejected designs
- Minimal code excerpts for illustration (not full tutorials)

Disallowed content types:

- Marketing language or feature lists
- Usage walkthroughs framed as “getting started”
- Performance claims, metrics, or benchmarks
- Screenshots meant to impress rather than explain

---

## E. Interaction and UX Constraints

1. The primary interaction mode is **reading and inspection**, not clicking or exploration.
2. Collapsible sections, if used, must default to *expanded* and only serve to reduce visual noise.
3. No gamified, animated, or “demo‑like” interactions.
4. Visual hierarchy should privilege concepts and structure over implementation detail.

---

## F. Relationship to Homepage and Projects

- Homepage defines **identity and intent**.
- SoionLab defines **research engine semantics**.
- Projects define **instances, experiments, or applications**.

SoionLab must not restate homepage identity claims, and must not compete with Projects as a showcase.

---

## G. Success Criteria

A SoionLab page is successful if, after reading:

- A researcher understands the core invariants and design philosophy.
- The reader can meaningfully discuss or critique the system.
- The reader does NOT ask “how do I use this to trade / deploy / profit?”
