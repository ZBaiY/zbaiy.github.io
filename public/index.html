    <h1>Hi, I’m Zhaoyu Bai</h1>

    <p>
      I work on <b>contract-driven quantitative research and execution systems</b>, with a focus on
      time correctness, execution realism, and reproducibility.

      One engine, one set of runtime semantics — backtest, mock, and live trading differ only by the Driver that owns time.
    </p>

    <p>
      My main project is <a href={SOIONLAB_REPO} target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SoionLab</a>,
      a unified quant research & execution framework where strategies are static specifications,
      ingestion is external, and execution is modeled explicitly via policy, routing, slippage, and matching layers.
    </p>

    <p>
      I am currently a PhD student in physics, and my research background strongly influences how I design systems:
      invariants first, contracts over conventions, and a strict separation between structure and runtime dynamics.
