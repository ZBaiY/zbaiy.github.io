# Homepage Review Guidance (Read-Only)

This document is written for **LLM reviewers only**  
(Claude / Gemini / Codex).

Your role is to **analyze and evaluate**, not to modify code or propose large redesigns -- unless you are granted with permissions.

This homepage represents a **personal research identity**, not a product, startup, or trading pitch.

---

## 1. Context & Intent

The homepage belongs to a **PhD candidate in theoretical physics (Weizmann Institute)**.

The site’s purpose is to answer one question only:

> “Is this person worth a 30-minute research conversation?”

It is **not** intended to:
- demonstrate alpha or trading performance
- sell a product, agent, or startup
- act as a general software engineering portfolio

All evaluation should be done from the perspective of:
- buy-side / systematic / quantitative research interviewers
- research-oriented industry collaborators
- PhD summit / early-career research recruiting

---

## 2. Core Identity (Must Be Preserved)

When reviewing the homepage, assume the following identity is **fixed**:

- Primary identity: **Researcher**, not developer
- Background: **Theoretical physics PhD**
- Current work: building a **deterministic personal research engine**
- Goal: running **controlled experiments** on trading strategies and derivatives signals

The homepage should communicate:
- intellectual seriousness
- research discipline
- system-level thinking

Not hustle, speed, or “shipping”.

---

## 3. 15-Second Skim Test (Critical)

Evaluate what a knowledgeable reader learns in **15 seconds**.

After 15 seconds, the reader should clearly understand:
1. Who this person is (research background)
2. What they are building (research engine, not a bot)
3. Why it is interesting (determinism, traceability, controlled experiments)

If any of these are unclear, mark it as a **primary issue**.

---

## 4. Signals to Look For

### Positive Signals (Desired)
- Clear research framing
- Explicit avoidance of performance claims
- Mentions of determinism, traceability, time semantics, portfolio accounting
- Evidence of systems built to support research, not outcomes

### Neutral Signals (Acceptable but Non-Essential)
- Technical stack details
- Implementation specifics
- Project names

### Negative Signals (Red Flags)
- Return numbers, PnL, performance charts
- Language suggesting “edge”, “alpha”, or profitability
- Framing as a “full-stack engineer”, “builder”, or “agent developer”
- Startup or product positioning

Flag any negative signals explicitly.

---

## 5. Structure Constraints (Important)

Assume the **section order and page structure are fixed**.

You may:
- comment on copy clarity
- comment on density / readability
- comment on visual hierarchy
- suggest micro-level improvements conceptually

You may **not**:
- propose new sections
- suggest removing entire sections (only recommend de-emphasis)
- redesign layout or navigation
- introduce new content themes

---

## 6. Evaluation Dimensions

Please evaluate the homepage on the following axes (0–10 each):

1. Research identity clarity
2. Credibility for research-oriented industry roles
3. 15-second skim readability
4. Visual density and hierarchy
5. Absence of misleading performance signaling

Each score must be justified with concrete observations.

---

## 7. Output Expectations

Your output should include:
- A concise summary of the current homepage design
- Key strengths (keep)
- Key confusions (fix)
- Key risks (must avoid)
- High-level improvement ideas (no edits)

Do **not** write code.  
Do **not** rewrite the homepage.  
Do **not** invent personal details.

If something is unclear, state that it is unclear rather than guessing.

---

## 8. Final Reminder

This homepage is an **invitation to conversation**, not proof of results.

Err on the side of:
- restraint
- clarity
- intellectual honesty

Over-selling is strictly worse than under-selling.
